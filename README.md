 The Polyester Project is the latest creation from SuicSoft. Currently, in ALPHA (it doesn't work), the new web browser uses
the Chrome Embeded Framework (CEF) for the reliablity of Google's browser  - but we've got some great <b>NEW Features</b>:

<b>Website time limits</b> - for example, think of your self as a comment guy on a news website. You waste all your time reading (and commenting) on the latest and greatest news. Now you can limit all your gossip and news time! 

<b>Suici</b> - We copied this one from MS (by that we mean Microsoft!). If you're at a website of a company who forgot to add a contact page and address, Suici will search Google Maps and other things to find them. All you have to do is click the li'l guy! He's like Cortana!

<b>Software Suggestions by Suici</b> - This is actually a feature of Suici! Suici will avoid all crapware when you search for software! Just Google "Free PDF Merger" and Suici will show you software without badware!

We're ready to make a website for polyester @ polyester.suicsoft.com, but that'll happen AFTER we get our first beta!
